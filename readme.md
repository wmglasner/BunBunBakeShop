Heuristic Evaluation
Bug 1 (Consistency and Standards):
The cart in top left might not indicate to some users that it is the shopping cart button. I replaced the SVG from the high fidelity wireframes in order to reduce potential user confusion, as well as generally give a cleaner look to the navigation bar.
Bug 2 (Aesthetic and minimalist design):
I felt that the navigation bar was too big. I reduced the size of the text, combined the locations and contact pages pages, and reduced the size of the title and logo.
Bug 3 (Aesthetic and minimalist design):
I removed some of the flavor text from the design, as I felt that it could be distracting for users, and allow for more visual information in future iterations.
Bug 4(Consistency and Standards )
The selection menu is a radio dial, rather than a dropdown for quantity. I felt that a dropdown was a more appropriate standard, so I altered the page to show a dropdown in concert with a new "Add to Cart" button.
